   <H2>Lawyer</H2>
   <p>My employment background is largely as a criminal lawyer but I left work about 10 years ago and am looking to return to work 
   in a new discipline. I have zero experience in coding but hope to catch up soon.</p> 
    <p>I moved to the West Coast of Canada just prior to Covid and spent the lockdown years there but have now returned to the UK. </p>
   <p>We moved to Bath, having raised our family in Oxford. My boys are off at university and I am at home with my dog. The walks are 
   fantastic here, as is the food, and I have even started paddleboarding (sewage spills permitting) but I am keen to get back to work and learn some modern skills.</p>
